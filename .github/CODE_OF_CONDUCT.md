# Code of Conduct

WeFa is an open-source project backed by N-SIDE. We expect everyone who engages with the
community to uphold the principles of respect, inclusion, and collaboration.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in the WeFa project a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity,
sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Showing empathy and respect for other people
- Offering and accepting constructive feedback gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the project and community
- Acknowledging the work of others and giving credit where it is due

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is
representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the
consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code:

1. **Correction** — Privately advising the individual on why their behavior was
   inappropriate and what change is required.
2. **Warning** — A written warning with clear consequences for continued behavior.
3. **Temporary Ban** — A temporary ban from any interaction or public communication with
   the community.
4. **Permanent Ban** — A permanent ban from any interaction with the community.

Maintainers may deviate from these guidelines if they believe a different response is
more appropriate to maintain a safe and welcoming environment.
