# Support

WeFa is an open-source project maintained by N-SIDE. Community participation keeps the
project healthy, so please review the options below before opening an issue.

## Self-Service Resources

- **Documentation:** Read the workspace guides in [`django/README.md`](../django/README.md)
  and [`vue/README.md`](../vue/README.md).
- **Issues:** Search existing [GitHub issues](https://github.com/n-side-dev/wefa/issues) for
  known bugs or feature requests.
- **Discussions:** Use the GitHub Discussions board (when enabled) for open questions,
  architecture ideas, or implementation advice.

## Getting Help

- **Bug reports:** Open an issue with reproduction steps, expected vs actual behaviour,
  and environment details. Include stack traces, test output, or screenshots where
  relevant.
- **Security concerns:** Follow the instructions in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) instead
  of filing a public issue.
- **Commercial support:** Contact [info@n-side.com](mailto:info@n-side.com) if
  you are interested in enterprise engagements or dedicated support agreements.

Thanks for helping us build an open and reliable WeFa ecosystem!
