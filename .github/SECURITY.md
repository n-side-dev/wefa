# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

WeFa currently distributes the following packages:

- `nside-wefa` (Django toolkit)
- `@nside/wefa` (Vue component library)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue. Instead,
email the maintainers at [security@n-side.com](mailto:security@n-side.com) with the
following information:

- Description of the vulnerability and the affected component(s)
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Expected impact

We will keep you informed as we investigate, and credit you in the release notes if you wish once a fix is published.

## Preferred Practices

- Use encrypted channels when sharing exploit details or credentials.
- Allow reasonable time for remediation before publicly disclosing the issue.
- Test only against environments you control; avoid attacking production deployments that
  belong to others.

Thank you for helping us keep WeFa users safe.
