# BareContainer

BareContainer is a lightweight flexbox wrapper around a `<RouterView />`.  
It ensures consistent layout sizing and makes sure that router depth is tracked (via `setupDepthTracker()`).
Use this container if you don't want any special content around your children routes/components.

## Props

BareContainer offers some props to control how the children component is rendered inside.

- `width`: "full" | "hug"\
  Controls if the wrapper should try to take the full remaining horizontal space, or just the space required by the children component.\
  "full" by default.
- `height`: "full" | "hug"\
  Controls if the wrapper should try to take the full remaining vertical space, or just the space required by the children component.\
  "full" by default.
- `direction`: "column" | "row"\
  Flex direction used this wrapper and exposed to children components/elements.\
  "column" by default.
- `center`: boolean\
  Controls if the child content should be horizontally and vertically centered inside the BareContainer.\
  false by default.

## Usage

```ts
/** router.ts*/

import { BareContainer } from '@nside/wefa/containers'

routes: [
  {
    path: '/my-route-path',
    name: 'my-route-name',
    meta: { title: 'My Route Title'},
    component: BareContainer,
    props: {
      width: "full",
      height: "full",
      direction: "columnn",
      center: false
    }
    children: [
      ...
    ]
  }
]
```
