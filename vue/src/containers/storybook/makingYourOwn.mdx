# Writing your own Container

You can write a custom Container SFC in any way you want, as long as you respect the following :

- In the `<script setup>`, you need to call `setupDepthTracker`. This is required to track the current depth in the whole application.
  ```ts
  import { setupDepthTracker } from '@nside/wefa/containers'
  const routerViewDepth = setupDepthTracker()
  ```
- Have a `<RouterView>` in your `<template>`. Without it children routes/components cannot be rendered.
